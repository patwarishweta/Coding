/*
*
* The code merges two sorted linked lists by using a dummy node to simplify the merging process. Here's the short intuition:

Dummy Node: A dummy node is used to easily build the merged list, with current pointing to the last node in the merged list.
Traverse Both Lists: Compare the current values of list1 and list2. Append the smaller value to the merged list,
and move the pointer of the corresponding list forward.
Append Remaining Nodes: Once one list is fully traversed, append the remaining nodes of the other list (since itâ€™s already sorted).
Return Merged List: Return dummy.next as the head of the new merged list.
This ensures an efficient merge with time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.

*  Time Complexity : O(n+m)
*  Space Complexity : O(1)
